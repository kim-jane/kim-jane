## Hi, I'm Jane! ☀️

I am...
- studying physics and computational math, science, and engineering (CMSE) at Michigan State University
- working on a variational Monte Carlo package with neural network ansätze written in C++ (private for now!)
- interested in ways machine learning algorithms can be integrated with quantum many-body methods
- curious about quantum computing, critical phenomena, and building symmetry-preserving neural networks
- reachable at jane.kim.phy@gmail.com
